# abstract_me

This is a Flutter experiment. What if an app could draw a portrait of you? Well using the camera would be too boring, so I used generic data like name, birth date, opinions and generative art to create an abstract image of yourself.

This image will be totally different for each and every person incorparating over 100 Parameters.

The project explored different layers, making a drawing libary and utilizes Flutters CustomPaint. Everything packed in a minimal design and supporting localization.
